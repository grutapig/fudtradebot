Event type is `ACCOUNT_UPDATE`.

* When balance or position get updated, this event will be pushed.
    * `ACCOUNT_UPDATE` will be pushed only when update happens on user's account, including changes on balances, positions, or margin type.
    * Unfilled orders or cancelled orders will not make the event `ACCOUNT_UPDATE` pushed, since there's no change on positions.
    * Only positions of symbols with non-zero isolatd wallet or non-zero position amount will be pushed in the "position" part of the event `ACCOUNT_UPDATE` when any position changes.

* When "FUNDING FEE" changes to the user's balance, the event will be pushed with the brief message:
    * When "FUNDING FEE" occurs in a **crossed position**, `ACCOUNT_UPDATE` will be pushed with only the balance `B`(including the "FUNDING FEE" asset only), without any position `P` message.
    * When "FUNDING FEE" occurs in an **isolated position**, `ACCOUNT_UPDATE` will be pushed with only the balance `B`(including the "FUNDING FEE" asset only) and the relative position message `P`( including the isolated position on which the "FUNDING FEE" occurs only, without any other position message).
